# USSD-simulator
This is a console based simulation of USSD operations using Python.
USSD is the primary service a GSM network operator provides for sending and receiving data (or strings) on a mobile device to/from the core network of a mobile operator.
USSD is an acronym for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data.
It does not require an internet connection from the device.
To access a service over USSD, a mobile subscriber dials a known string (e.g., *123#) for a service, the home network of the cellular operator responds with the required menu or content. A USSD session established between the handset and a USSD application for an interactive interaction.
